- [ ] Panel class needs to be cut in half
- [ ] Check the Events class logic. Why did you decide to put eveything in one place.
- [ ] check all events for the API
- [x] redo button in the API
- [ ] PointEvents must be refactored
- [x] flickering on hove in the side panel
- [ ] think about a way to make the panel less annoying(opaque in some cases OR maybe give the user a way to use the functionality through the API)
- [x] fantom move events(when closing)
- [ ] dynamic line is not working sometimes after placing a point(placing and moving fast?)
- [x] if the head was red and then we removed all points, it should be reset, otherwise there's a flash of redness on next point add event
- [ ] ok with the state of the app and ready to write tests?
